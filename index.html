                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me 
                learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enrolled
                by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful thing 
                about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
                , and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,was outstanding. 
                It took my learniing to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact, i've often
                referred to it during interviews as an example of my developer after receiving multiple offers 100% recommend! "
